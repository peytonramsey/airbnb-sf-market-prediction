# airbnb-sf-market-prediction
This project aimed to build a supervised machine learning model to predict which Airbnb listings in San Francisco were most likely to receive high booking volume. Using a dataset of 12,000+ listings, our team explored the impact of pricing, location, room type, host status, and review scores on booking performance.  

We cleaned and preprocessed the data in R, applying feature engineering techniques to create 15+ predictors from host metrics, pricing structure, and property characteristics. I led the model development process, implementing and tuning multiple classification algorithms including logistic regression, bagged trees, LightGBM, and Random Forest. Model evaluation was conducted using cross-validation and ROC AUC as the primary metric.  

The final Random Forest model achieved a ROC AUC of 95%, outperforming all other models in classifying high-booking listings. I also created data visualizations using ggplot2 to highlight key trends in pricing, Superhost status, and neighborhood performance. These insights informed our final recommendation: to price listings 5â€“10% below the market median and apply optimized weekly discounts, projecting a 14.3% increase in booking rates.
